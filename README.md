ksp swingwing spaceplanes

Tomcat Nextgen Article 1 series
description: aerospace trainer variant
vtol: rockets
auxiliary: twin rocket afterburner like nf-104a
control notes: be patient and do not overcontrol when flying
design notes: large turbofan engines required to maintain a dual engine design
space flight: insufficient delta-v and control
extra: can deorbit from space carrier or boost into space for short intercept

Tomcat Nextgen Article 5 series
description: basic aerospace fighter variant
vtol: none
auxiliary: none
control notes: has a lot of power at low altitude - watch dynamic pressure
design notes: meant to represent the first attempts at nuclear powered fighters
space flight: insufficient delta-v and control
extra: can deorbit from space carrier or boost into space for short intercept

Tomcat Nextgen Article 20 series
description: hyper aerospace interceptor variant
vtol: plasma
auxiliary: twin plasma wakefield afterburner and warp drive
control notes: be careful and practice to make use of the vehicle's full power
design notes: built early but continually refined and uses twin antimatter main engines
space flight: limited delta-v
extra: may be capable of underwater travel

Tomcat Nextgen Article 45 series
description: aerospace interdiction fighter variant
vtol: combined with main
auxiliary: twin dt vista space engines with warp drive
control notes: be sure to set dt vista isp to maximum on both engines
design notes: void in the rear to move cog forward and uses steerable antimatter engines
space flight: true fighter design with a large amount of delta-v
extra: may be capable of underwater travel

Tomcat Nextgen Article 47 series
description: touring freighter
vtol: combined with main
auxiliary: tokamak fusion engine
control notes: have patience getting it to orbit
design notes: built when investigating all types of engines for swingwings
space flight: limited delta-v
extra: economical for it's large size

Tomcat Nextgen Article 48 series
description: interstellar fighter variant
vtol: combined with main
auxiliary: twin magnetic nozzles
control notes: be careful about engine vectoring at high thrust settings
design notes: built when trying to increase delta-v on larger designs
space flight: true fighter design with a large amount of delta-v
extra: 4 main engine array is awkward along with placement and size of warp engine

Tomcat Nextgen Article 49 series
description: interstellar interdiction fighter variant
vtol: combined with main
auxiliary: twin magnetic nozzles
control notes: be careful about engine vectoring at high thrust settings
design notes: built when trying to increase delta-v on larger designs to the next level
space flight: true fighter design with a very large amount of delta-v
extra: contains ssto exploration probe and redundant atmospheric engines

Tomcat Nextgen Article 50 series
description: interstellar ultimate interceptor variant
vtol: combined with main
auxiliary: twin plasma wakefield afterburners
control notes: be careful about engine vectoring at high thrust settings
design notes: built when trying to build the ultimate vehicle for ksp
space flight: true interceptor design with a huge amount of delta-v
extra: as fast as the smaller interceptor but has better range than any other vehicle
