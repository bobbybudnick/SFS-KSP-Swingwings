Tomcat Nextgen Article 1 series  
description: aerospace trainer variant  
vtol: rockets  
auxiliary: twin rocket afterburner like nf-104a  
control notes: be patient and do not overcontrol when flying  
design notes: large turbofan engines required to maintain a dual engine design  
space flight: insufficient delta-v and control  
extra: can deorbit from space carrier or boost into space for short intercept

Tomcat Nextgen Article 5 series  
description: basic aerospace fighter variant  
vtol: none  
auxiliary: none  
control notes: has a lot of power at low altitude - watch dynamic pressure  
design notes: meant to represent the first attempts at nuclear powered fighters  
space flight: insufficient delta-v and control  
extra: can deorbit from space carrier or boost into space for short intercept

Tomcat Nextgen Article 20 series  
description: hyper aerospace interceptor variant  
vtol: plasma  
auxiliary: twin plasma wakefield afterburner and warp drive  
control notes: be careful and practice to make use of the vehicle's full power  
design notes: built early but continually refined and uses twin antimatter main engines  
space flight: limited delta-v  
extra: may be capable of underwater travel

Tomcat Nextgen Article 45 series  
description: aerospace interdiction fighter variant  
vtol: combined with main  
auxiliary: twin dt vista space engines with warp drive  
control notes: be sure to set dt vista isp to maximum on both engines  
design notes: void in the rear to move cog forward and uses steerable antimatter engines  
space flight: true fighter design with a large amount of delta-v  
extra: may be capable of underwater travel

description: touring freighter  
vtol: combined with main  
auxiliary: tokamak fusion engine  
control notes: have patience getting it to orbit  
design notes: built when investigating all types of engines for swingwings  
space flight: limited delta-v  
extra: economical for it's large size

Tomcat Nextgen Article 48 series  
description: interstellar fighter variant  
vtol: combined with main  
auxiliary: twin magnetic nozzles  
control notes: be careful about engine vectoring at high thrust settings  
design notes: built when trying to increase delta-v on larger designs  
space flight: true fighter design with a large amount of delta-v  
extra: 4 main engine array is awkward along with placement and size of warp engine

Tomcat Nextgen Article 50 series  
description: interstellar ultimate interceptor variant  
vtol: combined with main  
auxiliary: twin plasma wakefield afterburners  
control notes: be careful about engine vectoring at high thrust settings  
design notes: built when trying to build the ultimate vehicle for ksp  
space flight: true interceptor design with a huge amount of delta-v  
extra: as fast as the smaller interceptor but has better range than any other vehicle
